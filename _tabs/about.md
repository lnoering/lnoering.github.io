## Welcome, I'm Leonardo H. Noering
- I'm a developer since 2008 and my journey of work have some languages like C, C++, Basic, Javascript, PHP, Shell Script and more...
- I worked with embedded systems using 8051, LPC2138 microchips.
    - I love IOT (Internet of things), and sometimes to have fun I do some thigs to my brother using Arduino like this: [Brooder](https://github.com/lnoering/chocadeira)
- I started my interest about the internet when I was younger. I love the things connected and because that I studied PHP by my self to do and see how the websites worked. (I did one website to improve my knowledge and I used PHP, HTML and CSS).
- I decided to change my focus to work to internet, more specific to ecommerce at 2013.
- I started with Magento the platform and I still working with it. I like it.


- This journey I looked to the ecosystem about ecommerce and I study doing some things by myself.
    - Google Recaptcha (Improve the security)
    - Google GTM (The evolution to connect the thigs like: google analytics, facebook pixel, more...)
    - ElasticSearch (The fast search to magento, now it's changed from one fork called opensearch)
    - Redis (Improve the Session and cache)
    - Database (Mysql, MariaDB or Percona I looked to the performance when I worked with Magento 1.8)
    - CloudFlare (To improve the performance of the stores with cache and the security from attacks)
    - Docker / Docker Compose (The best way to work with all. It's the way to create the ecosystem to run the project at local and production using the same softwares version. Create one time and can share with other developers the docker-compose to run the same)

- Now I'm creating one server and putting the magento 2 to run to follow this list of improvements to my knowledge.
